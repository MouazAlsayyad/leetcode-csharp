## IsAnagram (C#)

This code implements a function named `IsAnagram` that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other.

### Anagram Definition

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. The letters in an anagram appear in the same frequency but in a different order.

### Function Description

The `IsAnagram` function takes two strings, `s` and `t`, as input and returns `true` if they are anagrams, otherwise it returns `false`.

### Implementation

1. **Length Check:** The function first checks if the lengths of both strings are equal. If not, they cannot be anagrams and the function returns `false`.

2. **Character Count Maps:** Two dictionaries, `countMapS` and `countMapT`, are created to store the frequency of each character in strings `s` and `t`, respectively.

3. **Character Iteration:** The function iterates through each character in `s` and `t` simultaneously:
    - It retrieves the current character from each string.
    - For each character, it checks if it exists in the corresponding map (`countMapS` for `s` and `countMapT` for `t`).
        - If the character doesn't exist, it's added to the map with a count of 1.
        - If the character already exists, its count is incremented by 1.

4. **Frequency Comparison:** After iterating through all characters, the function compares the two dictionaries to ensure they have the same characters with the same frequencies. 
    - It iterates through each key-value pair (character and its count) in `countMapS`.
    - For each key in `countMapS`, it checks if the same key exists in `countMapT`.
        - If the key doesn't exist in `countMapT` or the corresponding value (count) in `countMapT` doesn't match the value in `countMapS`, it means the characters have different frequencies and the function returns `false`.

5. **Anagram Check:** If all characters and their frequencies match in both dictionaries, the strings are anagrams, and the function returns `true`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string. This is because the character iteration and comparison dominate the execution time and scale linearly with the string length.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this function is O(1) or constant, assuming the character sets in both strings are limited. The dictionaries used have a fixed size based on the character set and do not grow significantly with the input string lengths.
