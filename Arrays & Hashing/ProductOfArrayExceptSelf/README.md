The provided code already calculates the product of all elements in an array except for the current element efficiently. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`: Stores the length of the input array `nums`.
   - `output`: A new array of the same size as `nums` to store the final result.

2. **Prefix Product Calculation:**
   - A loop iterates from index 1 to `n-1` (excluding the first and last elements).
   - For each element `i` in `output`, it's calculated as the product of the previous element `output[i-1]` and the corresponding element `nums[i-1]`. This essentially builds a product of all elements to the left of the current index.
   - The first element `output[0]` is set to 1 because there's no element to its left.

3. **Postfix Product Calculation:**
   - A variable `postfix` is initialized to 1.
   - Another loop iterates from `n-1` down to 0 (traversing the array in reverse order).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The current element `output[i]` is multiplied by the current value of `postfix`. This represents the product of all elements to the right of the current index.
     - The `postfix` variable is then updated by multiplying it with the current element `nums[i]`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - The `output` array now contains the product of all elements except for themselves at their respective positions. The function returns this `output` array.

This approach avoids using additional arrays like `prefix` and `postfix` as seen in the commented-out section. It's a space-optimized and efficient solution.
